Hi! I'm having some trouble in getting my tests to pass for the file ListExamples.java. The output makes me believe that the problem has something to do with the structure of the merged list. I'm guessing the problem could lie on either the lists are not merging as they should be or the merged list is not sorted correctly but I'm not entirely sure.
